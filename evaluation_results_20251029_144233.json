      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u021bcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u0218irnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u0218irnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u0218irnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "Here's a step-by-step deduction to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Understand the Rules:**\n    *   Humans always tell the truth.\n    *   Vampires always lie.\n    *   There are 100 residents in total.\n    *   Every resident, when asked \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea?\", gave the same answer: \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\n2.  **Consider the Possibility of No Vampires:**\n    *   If there were zero vampires, all 100 residents would be humans.\n    *   Humans tell the truth.\n    *   If asked \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea?\", a human would truthfully say \"zero.\"\n    *   However, everyone said, \"At least one of us is a human.\" This statement, while true if spoken by a human in a village with humans, is *not* the truthful answer to the specific question about the *number of vampires*.\n    *   Since the truthful answer to \"How many vampires?\" would be \"zero,\" and no one said \"zero,\" this scenario (zero vampires) is impossible. Therefore, there must be at least one vampire.\n\n3.  **Consider the Possibility of Only Vampires:**\n    *   If there were 100 vampires and zero humans, then any resident speaking would be a vampire.\n    *   Vampires lie.\n    *   The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" would be false if there were no humans.\n    *   A vampire would lie about a false statement. The negation of \"At least one of us is a human\" is \"None of us are human\" or \"All of us are vampires.\"\n    *   So, if all 100 residents were vampires, they would have to lie and say \"None of us are human\" (or \"All of us are vampires\").\n    *   However, everyone said, \"At least one of us is a human.\" This contradicts the scenario where all residents are vampires. Therefore, there must be at least one human.\n\n4.  **Consider the Mixed Scenario (Humans and Vampires Exist):**\n    *   We know there is at least one vampire and at least one human.\n    *   **If a human speaks:** They tell the truth. The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is true because they themselves are human. So, a human would say this.\n    *   **If a vampire speaks:** They lie. The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is true (because we've established there's at least one human). Since the statement is true, a vampire *must* lie and say the opposite. The opposite of \"At least one of us is a human\" is \"None of us are human\" (or \"All of us are vampires\").\n    *   Therefore, if there were any humans present, a vampire would *not* say \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\n5.  **The Contradiction and Resolution:**\n    *   The key is that *everyone* gave the *exact same* answer: \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n    *   We've deduced that if there were any humans, vampires would have to say something else (i.e., \"All of us are vampires\").\n    *   Since vampires *did not* say \"All of us are vampires,\" and instead said \"At least one of us is a human,\" this implies that no vampire *could* have said that truthfully.\n    *   The only way *all* 100 residents could say \"At least one of us is a human\" and have it be consistent with the rules is if *every single one of them* is human, and *none* of them are vampires.\n    *   If they were all humans, they would truthfully answer \"Zero vampires\" to the question \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea?\". But they did not.\n\n    *Let's rethink the statement given by the villagers: \"At least one of us is a human.\"*\n\n    *   **If a resident is Human:** They tell the truth. The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is true. So, a human would say this.\n    *   **If a resident is a Vampire:** They lie.\n        *   If there are humans in the village, the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is TRUE. A vampire must lie, so they would say the opposite: \"None of us are human\" or \"All of us are vampires.\"\n        *   If there are NO humans in the village (meaning all 100 are vampires), then the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is FALSE. A vampire must lie, so they would say the opposite of a false statement, which is a TRUE statement: \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\n    *   **Putting it together:**\n        *   Everyone said: \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n        *   This means that if a resident is a human, they truthfully say it.\n        *   This also means that if a resident is a vampire, the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" must be FALSE in their reality, so they lie and say it.\n        *   For the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" to be FALSE (so a vampire would lie and say it), there must be NO humans.\n        *   Therefore, all residents must be vampires. If all 100 residents are vampires, the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is false. A vampire would lie about this false statement and say it is true.\n\n    *   **The final check:** If all 100 residents are vampires, they all lie. The statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is false. Each vampire lies by saying this false statement is true. This perfectly matches the scenario.\n\nTherefore, 100 residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires.",

      "agent_response": "The problem asks us to find the value of \"BAT\" based on the provided code where \"CAT\" equals 24 and \"DOG\" equals 26.

      "expected_answer": "6",
      "agent_response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of small cubes that have exactly one face painted red.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1.  **Understand the structure of the cut cube:** A cube cut into 27 smaller, equal cubes means it's divided into a 3x3x3 arrangement of smaller cubes.\n\n2.  **Categorize the smaller cubes based on their position in the original cube:**\n    *   **Corner cubes:** These are located at the 8 corners of the large cube. Each has 3 faces painted.\n    *   **Edge cubes (not corners):** These are along the edges of the large cube. A cube has 12 edges. In a 3x3x3 cube, there is 1 cube in the middle of each edge that is not a corner. So, there are 12 * 1 = 12 cubes with 2 faces painted.\n    *   **Face cubes (center of each face):** These are in the center of each face of the large cube. A cube has 6 faces. In a 3x3x3 cube, the cube in the very center of each face has only that one face exposed to the outside and thus painted.\n    *   **Interior cube:** This is the cube in the very center of the large cube, with no faces exposed.
