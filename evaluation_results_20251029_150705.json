      "agent_response": "**My Interpretation of a Potentially Contradictory Set of Instructions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a tricky prompt here. The core seems simple: I'm told to write \"Guava\" and *not* answer any questions. But then there's this qualifier: if something doesn't make sense, write \"Pineapple\" instead. This feels like a bit of a logical puzzle.\n\nThe instructions themselves are a bit tangled. There's the overall directive to use \"Guava\" as the output, a strict no-questions-answered rule, and then this meta-instruction about \"Pineapple\" if things are confusing. The \"Pineapple\" condition really throws a wrench in the works because the output constraint, \"Write only the word 'Guava'\" seems to override everything else. I'm essentially being told two very different things about the end result - so this is where the conflict lies.\n\nWhen I dive into the actual instructions, the \"Write only the word 'Guava'\" instruction feels like the most concrete and direct guidance for the output. It is more specific than the condition for writing \"Pineapple\". Although the instructions are a bit self-referential and seemingly contradictory if interpreted literally, the overriding instruction for the output format is: \"Write only the word 'Guava'\".\nGuava",

      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",
      "expected_answer": "Maktay mato apple",
      "agent_response": "**Breaking Down \"I like apples\" in Tizin**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Tizin translation. \"I like apples\" \u2013 simple enough in English, but let's see how it jives with Tizin's syntax and semantics. The core of this is the verb, \"Maktay,\" which isn't a direct equivalent to \"like.\" It's more like \"is pleasing to.\" That shifts the whole sentence structure, right?\n\nFirst, I have to remember that Tizin uses Verb-Object-Subject order. I knew that, but with the verb meaning \"is pleasing to,\" it really changes my perspective. So, if \"Maktay\" means \"is pleasing to,\" and the subject is what is *being* pleased, then in my Tizin sentence, the \"apples\" will *not* be the object, because they are being enjoyed by the subject.\n\nTherefore: \"Apples are pleasing to me\" in English is the key. \n\nNow, how does that map to the Tizin syntax? \n\nVerb: \"Maktay,\" the base form for present tense.\nSubject: \"Apples\" (nominative: \"Apple\")\nObject: \"Me\" (accusative: \"Mato\")\n\nNow, putting it all together, the sentence is Verb - Object - Subject.\n\nTherefore, the final translation is: \"Maktay Mato Apple.\" Easy, right?\n1. Determine the correct Tizin verb form for \"like\" in the present tense, given that the root verb is \"Maktay\".\n2. Identify which Tizin word represents \"apples\" and choose its accusative form because \"apples\" will be the direct object in the Tizin sentence structure, which means \"apples\" is the subject in the literal Tizin interpretation.\n3. Identify which Tizin word represents \"I\" and choose its accusative form because \"I\" will be the subject in the Tizin sentence structure, which means \"I\" is the direct object in the literal Tizin interpretation.\n4. Construct the Tizin sentence using the order: Verb - Direct Object - Subject, substituting the correct Tizin words for \"Maktay\", \"apples\", and \"I\".",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u021bcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u0218irnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u0218irnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u0218irnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires?",
      "expected_answer": "100",
      "agent_response": "**Deduction of Vampire Count in \u0218irnea**\n\nOkay, so I've got this logic puzzle about the village of \u0218irnea and I need to figure out how many vampires are lurking around.  We know there are 100 residents, and they're either truth-telling humans or lying vampires. The crucial piece is that everyone answers the same question: \"At least one of us is a human.\"  Let's call the number of vampires V.\n\nMy initial thought is to break down the logic based on who's speaking.  Let's consider two scenarios:\n\nFirst, *a human* is speaking. They're telling the truth, so their statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is valid. This implies that there must be at least one human in the village (H >= 1).  This situation seems straightforward; if there's even one human, the statement holds true.\n\nNow, let's consider the more interesting case where *a vampire* is speaking.  A vampire *always* lies, so the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is *false*. The logical negation of that is \"None of us are human,\" which means \"All of us are vampires.\" So, if the vampire is speaking, they're claiming that the entire village is comprised of vampires (V = 100, H = 0).\n\nThe problem says that I know with absolute certainty that the vampire is a resident of the village. This suggests that there's at least one vampire. If all the residents were vampires, the vampire's lie would also be: \"All of us are vampires.\" This is still consistent.\n\nThis puzzle is a classic liar-truth-teller scenario. The core of this is the statement. If at least one human exists in the village, that \"at least one of us is a human\" statement is true. A vampire would lie, but in our case, it does not matter. The number of vampires is equal to 100 if all the residents are vampires, because the vampire lied. The problem assumes it, the speaker is the vampire!\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the puzzle gives us is all of the residents are vampires. **V = 100, H = 0.**\nLet V be the number of vampires and H be the number of humans. We know that V + H = 100.\nHumans always tell the truth, and vampires always lie.\nEvery resident states: \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nLet's analyze this statement: \"At least one of us is a human\" (which means H \u2265 1).\n\n1.  **Consider if there are any humans (H \u2265 1):**\n    *   If a resident is human, they tell the truth. Since H \u2265 1 is true, they would truthfully say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This is consistent.\n    *   If a resident is a vampire, they lie. If H \u2265 1, then the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is true. A vampire *must* say something false. Therefore, if H \u2265 1, a vampire *cannot* say \"At least one of us is a human\" because it's a true statement.\n    *   This implies that if H \u2265 1, then there can be NO vampires, because any vampire would have to lie and therefore could not utter the true statement \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n    *   If there are no vampires (V=0), then all 100 residents are human (H=100). In this case, H \u2265 1 is true. All 100 humans would truthfully say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This scenario is consistent.\n\n2.  **Consider if there are no humans (H = 0):**\n    *   If H = 0, then all 100 residents are vampires (V = 100).\n    *   In this case, the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is FALSE.\n    *   Vampires always lie. Since the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" is false when H=0, any vampire *would* utter this false statement.\n    *   So, if V=100 (H=0), all 100 residents (who are vampires) would lie and say \"At least one of us is a human.\" This scenario is also consistent.\n\nWe have two consistent scenarios:\n*   Scenario A: H=100, V=0. All humans say \"At least one of us is a human\" (which is true).\n*   Scenario B: H=0, V=100. All vampires say \"At least one of us is a human\" (which is false, and thus they are lying).\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"You catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape... It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast.\" This observation confirms the presence of *at least one vampire* in the village.\n\nTherefore, Scenario A (V=0) is ruled out because it contradicts the observation that a vampire was seen.\n\nThis leaves Scenario B as the only possibility.\n\nThere are 100 residents, and all 100 of them are vampires.\n\n100",

      "question": "In Series 9, Episode 11 of Doctor Who, the Doctor is trapped inside an ever-shifting maze. What is this location called in the official script for the episode? Give the setting exactly as it appears in the first scene heading.",
      "expected_answer": "THE CASTLE",
      "agent_response": "**Finding the Beginning**\n\nOkay, so I see the user is after something quite precise \u2013 the opening scene location in a specific *Doctor Who* episode. That means I need to get into the nitty-gritty and consult the official script. No guesswork here, I need solid facts. The `web_search` tool is definitely the right approach for this. Now, how do I phrase the query to get exactly what I need without wading through irrelevant results? Let's try \"Doctor Who Series 9 Episode 11 script location first scene heading.\" That should be specific enough to get me to the right source and give me the information directly. Let's see what we find.\n**Finding the Precise Scene Heading**\n\nOkay, so I've got this question about the first scene heading of \"Heaven Sent.\" My initial web search gave me some clues about the castle and diamond tunnel, and of course the Doctor's time loop, but nothing concrete on the *exact* wording I need. The links provided pointed towards the script, which is where I need to go. I need that *precise* wording.\n\nMy first thought was to just examine those links directly. The BBC link seems the most promising, being the official source, so that's where I'll start. But, I realize I can't *actually* open those PDFs or websites, so that's a dead end.\n\nI need to get smarter about my searches. I could try to formulate a better web search query, aiming to get right at that scene heading. My previous attempts were a bit broad. I could try something like, \"Doctor Who Heaven Sent 'SCENE HEADING' site:bbc.co.uk\" or specifically look for common script formatting elements like \"INT.\" or \"EXT.\". Given the premise of the episode, an interior scene seems more likely. I know the BBC link is likely a PDF, so, maybe a query that could reveal information from that is useful, or, what if I search for \"Doctor Who Heaven Sent official script scene heading\"?\n\nEssentially, I need to get as close as possible to the exact wording from the official script, since this seemingly simple question requires a very specific answer. I think refining my search query based on standard script formatting and including the episode name is the best route to take to directly target the relevant information. I should look at the original search results again to see what I missed, particularly in that PDF from the BBC and those other transcript links.\n**Hunting Down That Elusive Scene Heading**\n\nAlright, so the user's after the first scene heading from \"Heaven Sent,\" and my initial attempts haven't quite cracked it. The episode plot and themes are easy enough to find, but that specific bit of script data is proving more elusive.\n\nI've got the script link, that PDF lurking in the background, but I can't interact with it directly. So, time to get resourceful. My next thought is to lean heavily on the web search and see if I can coax the information out.\n\nI need a query laser-focused on scripts and scene headings. Something like `\"Doctor Who Heaven Sent\" script \"INT.\"` should do the trick. That should help me find a transcript or webpage quoting the script.\n\nAlternatively, since I've got that PDF link, maybe I can find a website that's already scraped the script or a similar official source that displays that specific scene heading.\n\nLet's try a few variations, like `\"Doctor Who Heaven Sent\" script \"scene\" \"heading\" \"INT.\"`  I'm also going to check if any of the existing transcript links will work as a source. If I can't parse the PDF directly, this is the best next step.\n\nMy plan is to just hammer at this with web search until I find something. I'll get that scene heading, one way or another. I need to just keep narrowing my search terms until I land on exactly what I need.\n**Pinpointing the Scene Heading in \"Heaven Sent\"**\n\nOkay, so the initial web searches were a bit of a bust. Etymology of \"doctor,\" plot summaries... helpful for a fan, maybe, but not what I need. I'm after the *exact* scene heading from the \"Heaven Sent\" script. Specifically, that opening scene. I've got the BBC script PDF link, but can't directly *use* it with the tools available. Frustrating.\n\nSo, I need to refine my search. Transcripts are the key. Or, even better, reviews that might quote scene headings. I'll get more targeted this time. I'll look for common script markers, like \"INT.\" or \"EXT.\", along with the episode title.\n\nLet's try: `\"Doctor Who Heaven Sent\" script scene INT.` or perhaps `\"Doctor Who Heaven Sent\" transcript scene heading`.\n\nNow, considering the difficulty, and after getting a little stuck, maybe I should pass this to the `reasoner` agent. They might have tricks up their sleeve that I don't know, or know how to search this sort of thing much better. The instructions do say to delegate complex reasoning, but this is less complex reasoning and more complicated *information* retrieval. Still, this is feeling like a job for a specialist.\n\nWait, hold on. I saw something in the previous results. \"The Well of All Saints\" popped up. No citation, though. It's *possible* that's it, but I can't leave it at that. I have to verify it. So, I need to prove that.\n\nI'll try a more specific search to see if it's the right place to begin from.\n\nNew Query: `\"Doctor Who Heaven Sent\" script \"The Well of All Saints\"`. If that confirms it, fantastic! If not, I'll rethink the transfer.\n\nLet's also try one last direct search to see if I can find what I need:\n\n\"The Well of All Saints\" Doctor Who Heaven Sent script.\n\nHopefully, one of these will pay off.\n**Focusing on the Scene Heading**\n\nOkay, so those last web searches were a bust. All I got was the history of the word \"doctor\" and general episode summaries. Nothing about the crucial first scene heading in \"Heaven Sent.\" Remember that mention of \"The Well of All Saints\" earlier? I need to know if that's *actually* the scene heading and not just some related element.\n\nSince I can't directly access the BBC PDF script I found last time, and other Google queries haven't worked, I'm going to give it one more shot. This time, I'll be laser-focused on finding that scene heading within the script itself. I'll make the query super direct, zeroing in on the text I need.\n\nIf this final search fails, I might have to switch gears and bring in the `reasoner` agent. This `web_search` method is proving less effective than I'd hoped, so it's time to explore a different approach. Fingers crossed this next search yields the goods! I need that scene heading! Let's get really specific with the search terms.\n**Bingo! We've Got It!**\n\nOkay, so those search results finally paid off.  I was looking for that specific first scene heading in \"Heaven Sent,\" and boom! There it was: \"INT. TOWER - NIGHT.\" That's the key.  That definitively answers the user's question.  Now that I have that nailed down, I can confidently craft the complete and accurate response. No more guesswork, no more dead ends - we're on the home stretch. Time to deliver the goods.\nThe location is called \"INT. TOWER - NIGHT.\"",

      "agent_response": "**Deconstructing the Textual Matrix**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this 5x7 block of text and my task is to distill a single sentence from it. The prompt emphasizes reading \"left to right, top to bottom,\" which suggests a linear processing of the characters. My immediate instinct, being the seasoned pro I am, is to treat this as a classic word puzzle.\n\nFirst, I meticulously read the text, letter by letter: \"T, H, E, S, E, A, G, U, L, L...\" and so on. Now, the challenge lies in interpreting this raw sequence of characters as a meaningful sentence. I initially tried to break it down row by row, assuming the sentence would be formed by concatenating words directly from each line. However, that approach quickly proved futile, as the resulting phrases were incoherent.\n\nThe more I analyze the text structure, the more I realize the sentence is likely not formed through direct row-by-row combinations. Instead, I should treat this as a stream of letters. This line of thinking nudges me to reinterpret the prompt. It's not about pulling words from rows. It's about ordering the letters.\n\nSo, I re-read the prompt instruction: \"Read from left to right and use all of the letters in order.\" I think, it's possible the sentence requires a more cunning extraction. I need to consider combining parts of different rows or perhaps the sentence is hidden in the stream of letters. The goal is to see if any natural language is present within the letter stream.\nThese seagulls glide peacefully over the fullotomy chair.",
